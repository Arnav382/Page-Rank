# Page-Rank
PageRank (developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin) revolutionized web search by generating a ranked list of web pages based on the underlying connectivity of the web. The PageRank algorithm is based on an ideal random web surfer who, when reaching a page, goes to the next page by clicking on a link.
